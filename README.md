# etch-a-sketch
Project to practice DOM manipulation. This is a basic sketchbook in the browser that operates like a mouse controlled Etch a Sketch using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Created the grid using flexbox with JS. Also worked with event listeners. I had two event listeners for when the mouse hovered over the cells, so I had to learn how to remove the event listener associated with the random color button. This was the part I struggled with mostly, since I was trying to fix the problem using flag variables. Also experimented with css transitions for the buttons.
