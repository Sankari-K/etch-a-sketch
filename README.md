Project to practice DOM manipulation

Created the grid using flexbox with JS. Also worked with event listeners. I had two event listeners for when the mouse hovered over the cells, so I had to learn how to remove the event listener associated with the random color button. This was the part I struggled with mostly, since I was trying to fix the problem using flag variables. Also experimented with css transitions for the buttons.
